# Working with Claude

These are my personal notes about developing the project with
Claude. These notes are the only part of this project which are not AI
created.

## Context

I'm in the process of learning to speak French and, from experience, I
learn best by using flash cards. I knew I wanted pronunciation with
the cards and I really wanted something that was ad-free.

## Claude

I had already purchased a license to use Claude so I started off by
just asking Claude for a suggested flash card system. I said I wanted
a system that would allow me to create my own cards, supported audio,
was ad-free and, ideally, didn't require a subscription (although a
one-time-purchase was okay).

Claude recommended Anki, which I had already heard about but hadn't
really looked into yet.

I also asked Claude for the best language to use for building my cards
and it recommended python.

So I had it create a project in python for building Anki flash cards.

## Development process

With the basic project created we started to iteratively build the project.

The first step was just creating a script which could parse a CSV
file.

With the CSV file parsing I then told Claude to build the Anki card deck.

I then added on the ability to swap the order of the words.

Adding the audio was equally as easy. I just asked Claude which
service I should use, it suggested Google and gave me complete
instructions.

Lastly I decided I wanted to move it all to a Google Sheet and again
asked Claude to walk me through the steps I needed to take to get this
working on the google side. Claude updated all the code.

## Thoughts

This worked amazingly well. By taking Claude through the development
steps one by one I was able to verify things along the way and get to
a working solution rather quickly. The only areas where Claude seemed
to have a hard time is not cleaning up things unless I specifically
asked it to. At one point I had it also generating images for the
slides, but ended up abandoning that idea. Although Claude removed
the code, it left the documentation in. I also noticed it created
redundant documentation in multiple markdown files. All of this was
easy enough to clean up by _telling_ Claude to clean it up, but it's
just a reminder of it's limitations.
